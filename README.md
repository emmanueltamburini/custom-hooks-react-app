# CustomHook

## CustomHook README

These are all custom hook that I has created to use in other projects in the future. This is only a raw code without context or a project that contains them

### Getting started

Before that you must run `yarn install` to install all dependencies of the app.

And finally you can run `yarn dev`

This project use the following dependencies:

- [Vite](<https://vitejs.dev/guide/>)
- [breaking bad api](<https://breakingbadapi.com/>)
